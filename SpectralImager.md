Satellite for Sustainable Development: Characterization of High-resolution Spectral Imager
=
NTNU is developing a high-spatial resolution camera for its next satellite, HYPSO-3. This MSc project will involve radiometric, spectral, geometric, and stray light calibrations of the new HYPSO-3 hyperspectral camera. ​

Once launched, the HYPSO-3 satellite will be used for water quality monitoring of fjords and lakes in order to help Norway achieve the UN's sustainable development goals. ​Saving fish farms from harmful algal blooms is a particularly important goal of the HYPSO-3 mission.

​Skills that will be learned:​
- How to use optical test set ups​
- What camera properties are important to spectral imaging​
- How cameras interact with other components in an autonomous robot (in this case, a satellite)
- Some programming (probably python) for data analysis

Notes:
I will find a co-advisor for this project. The HYPSO project usually has about 10 masters students working on projects, so there will be others to chat with about your project and to socialize with. This project can be continued as a thesis.
