NTNU's [HYPSO-1](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/smallsat/ntnu-smallsat-lab) satellite records images of the ocean in 120 spectral bands which can resolve many unexpected features in the earth's oceans. One of the objectives of the satellite mission is to monitor algae. Unfortunately, there are only small amounts of ground truth data for algal blooms. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can learn to detect patterns which indicate the state of ocean ecosystems from very small amounts of training data. This project will focus on semi-supervised techniques because only small amounts of ground truth data are available. 

The analysis will focus on datasets at Svalbard and in Frohavet which were collected by HYPSO-1 starting in 2022.
