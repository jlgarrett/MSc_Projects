Interpretable and controllable feature extraction for scientific inference with big data
--
Advisor: Joseph Garrett

Machine learning techniques for feature extraction give great exploratory power when confronted with big data. Thus they seem ideal for finding chlorophyll and other pigments in hyperspectral images, such as those collected by the NTNU's  [HYPSO-1](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/smallsat/ntnu-smallsat-lab) satellite. Unfortunately, they are often hard to control and interpret. Therefore, scientists often revert to simpler solutions, such as using band ratio algorithms. 

This project will involve developing a feature extraction technique which scientists can control and interpret more easily. The tentative plan is to develop independent component analysis so that additional constraints can be imposed on the optimization problem. However, if you desire to adapt a different feature extraction technique, such as locality preserving projections or autoencoders, that is also possible. The technique will be tested on scenes that HYPSO-1 or the hyperspectal drones have recently imaged, with a particular focus on scenes where some ground truth is known. When I thought of this project, I was particularly inspired by [this algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09699.pdf), although there is no need to follow it too closely. 

This project will be part of [ELO-Hyp](https://elohyp.wordpress.com/project/), in which NTNU is collaborating with several Romanian institutions. It is likely possible to join the yearly meeting for this project, at which you could present your results. Moreover, there will likely opportunities to take part in hyperspectral UAV imaging missions in connection with a few other ongoing projects. 

Note that this project will probably require quite a bit of mathematics (e.g. \[non-\]convex optimization theory) in addition to programming. So it could be an intriguing choice if you enjoy wrestling with equations for hours. If you are more intersted in analyzing data than developing novel algorithms, some of the other projects I've listed may be better choices.
