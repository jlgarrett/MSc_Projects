Data fusion for spatial resolution enhancement of the HYPSO-2 satellite
=

NTNU smallsat lab is launching a new satellite in summer 2024. The HYPSO-2 satellite has two payloads, a high-resolution RGB imager and a low-spatial-resolution HSI imager. We'd like to fuse the data from these two cameras to have high-spatial-resolution spectral images. 

Once launched, the HYPSO-3 satellite will be used for water quality monitoring of fjords and lakes in order to help Norway achieve the UN's sustainable development goals. â€‹Saving fish farms from harmful algal blooms is a particularly important goal of the HYPSO-3 mission.
 
Previous methods for data fusion have focused on the creation of a larger, high spatial/spectral-resolution dataset. In this project, you could develop the fusion in the context of different applications, such as the detection of algae.

Notes:
I will find a co-advisor for this project. The HYPSO project usually has about 10 masters students working on projects, so there will be others to chat with about your project and to socialize with. This project can be continued as a thesis.
