Artificial intelligence in remote sensing: characterizing uncertainty and assessing forest management risk 
--
Advisor: Joseph Garrett

NTNU and [S&T Norway](https://stcorp.no/) are developing a convolutional neural network to run on-board hyperspectral imaging satellites such as NTNU's own [HYPSO-1](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/smallsat/ntnu-smallsat-lab) or ESA's soon-to-launch CHIME. It is a U-Net designed to classify hyperspectral images in real-time. This FauBai CNN will be used to identify and characterize forests. The first iteration of the algorithm identifies (1) where a forest is present and (2) what is the dominant tree type (pine, spruce, or deciduous). 

This master's project will focus on characterizing how the FauBai CNN responds to certain kinds of errors present in the hyperspectral data, such as smile and keystone. Then the project should consider either (1) training and pre-processing strategies for mitigating these uncertainties or (2) an assessment of the risk that these sorts of uncertainties pose to a forestry management system.  
As part of this project, you will have the opportunity to join several meetings with S&T Norway and ESA, which could be a nice starting point for exploring the space industry.
