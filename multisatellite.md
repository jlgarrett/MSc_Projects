Multi-satellite data fusion for ocean color remote sensing
--
Advisor: Joseph Garrett

Harmful algal blooms pose a significant risk to fish farmers, and the risk is only increasing because of climate change. Hyperspectral imaging satellites, such as NTNU's  [HYPSO-1](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/smallsat/ntnu-smallsat-lab), can resolve the characteristics of algal blooms near fish farms. However, because such satellites are limited by their data and energy budgets, they can only image a limited number of locations each day. A harmful algal bloom monitoring system would benefit from incorporating satellites which image the whole earth at a high spatial resolution, such as Sentinel-2. 

This master's project would involve investigating how to fuse multispectral images from the Sentinel-2 satellite with hyperspectral images from the HYPSO-1 satellite. The project should also consider how to automate the data fusion so that it could be incorporated into a real-time HAB monitoring system. 

This topic is related to the ongoing HYPSCI project at NTNU, which is involved in validating and developing the data products provided by the HYPSO-1 satellite.
