Multi-satellite data fusion for algal bloom monitoring
--
Advisor: Joseph Garrett

Harmful algal blooms pose a significant risk to fish farmers, and the risk is only increasing because of climate change. Hyperspectral imaging satellites, such as NTNU's  [HYPSO-1](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/smallsat/ntnu-smallsat-lab), can resolve the characteristics of algal blooms near fish farms. However, because such satellites are limited by their data and energy budgets, they can only image a limited number of locations each day. A harmful algal bloom monitoring system would benefit from incorporating satellites which image the whole earth at a high spatial resolution, such as Sentinel-2. 

This master's project would involve investigating how to fuse multispectral images from the Sentinel-2 satellite with hyperspectral images from the HYPSO-1 satellite. The project should also consider how to automate the data fusion so that it could be incorporated into a real-time HAB monitoring system. 

The project is part of a collaboration with Grieg Seafood and Salmar, two fish farming companies. It would be possible to join meetings with the whole collaboration and perhaps even present your work at them, if desired. It might even be possible to visit some fish farms.
