Prediction of hyperspectral feature evolution using ocean simulations

NTNU's [HYPSO-1](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/smallsat/ntnu-smallsat-lab) satellite records images of the ocean in 120 spectral bands which can resolve many unexpected features in the earth's oceans. However, it is one thing to observe something unusual, but it is another to predict how it will change in time. For example, if a harmful algal bloom is observed near a fish farm, we would like to know if it will move towards or away from the farm. 

NTNU and SINTEF jointly work on the SINMOD ocean simulation model. The goal of this project is to develop a framework for how SINMOD can be used to predict the development of unexpected spectral features in the ocean. Tentatively, the features will be identified using independent component analysis. The accuracy of the framework will be evaluated in situations where HYPSO-1 has recorded a time-series of images at a given location. 

The project is related to a collaboration with Grieg Seafood and Salmar, two fish farming companies. It would be possible to join meetings with the whole collaboration and perhaps even present your work at them, if desired. It might even be possible to visit some fish farms.
