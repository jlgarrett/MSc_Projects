Coastal ecosystem monitoring with UAVs

Advisor: Researcher from NIVA (TBD)
Co-advisor: Joseph Garrett

The coastal environment contains many ecologically important species such as kelp and seagrass. Monitoring and mapping the coast can be a tool for ensuring the health and prosperity of these species. For that reason, [NIVA](https://www.niva.no/), in collaboration with NTNU, is developing a system for mapping the coast with drones. Currently, several different imagers are carried by different drones, including an rgb camera, a multispectral camera, and a hyperspectral camera. The hyperspectral camera measures the most information, while the rgb camera can image the largest area with the highest resolution. In the project, we would like to fuse the information collected by the sensors in order to combine the advantages of the different imaging modalities. 

This project will focus on using doing fieldwork with the UAVs and applying the observations to better understand seagrass / seaweed ecology and dynamics, their seasonality, and their role in the carbon cycle.

As this project is associated with NIVA and the [SeaBee consortium](https://seabee.no/), it will be possible to access the Sigma2 supercomputer. In addition, funds are available to support a drone mapping expedition to the Norwegian coast, if more data are desired. Moreover, there may be imaging missions during the semester which you could join.
