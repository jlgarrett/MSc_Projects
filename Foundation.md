Foundation Model for Unmixing Hyperspectral Remote Sensing
=

NTNU's HYPSO-1 satellite has been collecting hyperspectral data of coastal oceans for 2 years, and HYPSO-2 is set to launch this summer. 
It has collected of 2.000 hyperspectral images, or more than a billion individual spectra. 
Thus, the data set is ready to be explored by AI. 

A foundation model is an unsupervised neural network which is trained on a very large dataset and which can be applied to a variety of tasks. 

The most famous foundation model, Chat-GPT, processes text, but several networks have been developed for remote sensing imagery. 
The foundation model trained here would probably be quite a bit smaller than some of those other networks, but would still adhere to the idea of a foundation model.

Unmixing a spectral image refers to partitioning each spectrum into possible components. 
It has become the most popular type of algorithm to apply to hyperspectral images. 
It's been shown to be very powerful on single images, but has rarely been applied to larger datasets. 
Thus this would be a very novel research topic. 

​Skills that will be learned:​
-Machine learning (various python libraries)
-Processing large datasets 
-Hyperspectral image processing 

Notes:
I will find a co-advisor for this project. The HYPSO project usually has about 10 masters students working on projects, so there will be others to chat with about your project and to socialize with. 
This project can be continued as a thesis. Although this is an extremely interesting research topic, I also think that it may be fairly challenging relative to the other masters project topics that I've offered. 
A love of mathematics is more important than prior machine learning experience, as I think some analytic derivations will probably be necessary for understanding how the networks operate.
